# My Personal Project: Tetris Game Project

## A Java-based classic arcade game

Introduction and background:
- This application is used to write a game named Tetris. Users will be able to control falling tetromino blocks, rotate them, and fit them into a grid. The game ends when the blocks fill up the screen. This application will record the time and grade on every previous game. Users can see if they do better than before. 
- The application is designed for anyone who enjoys puzzle games, particularly fans of classic arcade games like Tetris.
- I personally enjoyed playing games and I am also interested in developing games. Also, developing a Tetris game in Java is an opportunity to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming and game development principles. It's a manageable but challenging project that allows for creativity in game mechanics and UI design while being a well-known project to demonstrate to future employers.
